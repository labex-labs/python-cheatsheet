Python CSV Module
</base-title>

The csv module provides tools to read from and write to CSV files, which are commonly used for data exchange.

    While you can read and write CSV files using basic file operations and string methods (like <code>open()</code> with <code>read</code> or <code>write</code> and <code>split()</code>), the <code>csv</code> module is designed to handle edge cases such as quoted fields, embedded delimiters, and different line endings. It ensures compatibility with CSV files generated by other programs (like Excel) and reduces the risk of parsing errors. For most CSV tasks, prefer the <code>csv</code> module over manual parsing.

To get started, import the module:

```python
import csv
```

## csv.reader()

This function receives a file which needs to be an [iterable of strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#id4:~:text=A%20csvfile%20must%20be%20an%20iterable%20of%20strings%2C%20each%20in%20the%20reader%E2%80%99s%20defined%20csv%20format). In other words, it should be the open file as it follows:

```python
import csv

file_path = 'file.csv'

# Read CSV file
with open(file_path, 'r', newline='') as csvfile:
  reader = csv.reader(csvfile)

  # Iterate through each row
  for line in reader:
    print(line)
```

This function returns a reader object which can be easily iterated over to obtain each row. Each column in the corresponding rows can be accessed by the index, without the need to use the built-in function [`split()`](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/manipulating-strings#split).

## csv.writer()

This function receives the file to be written as a csv file, similar to the reader function, it should be invoked as this:

```python
import csv

file_path = 'file.csv'

# Open file for writing CSV
with open(file_path, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
  writer = csv.writer(csvfile)

  # do something
```

The "do something" block could be replaced with the use of the following functions:

### writer.writerow()

Writes a single row to the CSV file.

```python
# Write header row
writer.writerow(['name', 'age', 'city'])
# Write data row
writer.writerow(['Alice', 30, 'London'])
```

### writer.writerows()

Writes multiple rows at once.

```python
# Prepare multiple rows
rows = [
    ['name', 'age', 'city'],
    ['Bob', 25, 'Paris'],
    ['Carol', 28, 'Berlin']
]
# Write all rows at once
writer.writerows(rows)
```

## csv.DictReader

Allows you to read CSV files and access each row as a dictionary, using the first row of the file as the keys (column headers) by default.

```python
import csv

# Read CSV as dictionary (first row becomes keys)
with open('people.csv', 'r', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    # Access columns by name instead of index
    for row in reader:
        print(row['name'], row['age'])
```

- Each `row` is an `OrderedDict` (or a regular `dict` in Python 3.8+).
- If your CSV does not have headers, you can provide them with the `fieldnames` parameter:

  ```python
  reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, fieldnames=['name', 'age', 'city'])
  ```

## csv.DictWriter

Lets you write dictionaries as rows in a CSV file. You must specify the fieldnames (column headers) when creating the writer.

```python
import csv

fieldnames = ['name', 'age', 'city']
rows = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'London'},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'city': 'Paris'}
]

# Write dictionaries to CSV
with open('people_dict.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()  # writes the header row
    writer.writerows(rows)
```

- Use `writer.writeheader()` to write the column headers as the first row.
- Each dictionary in `writer.writerows()` must have keys matching the `fieldnames` specified when creating the writer.

## Additional params to csv.reader() and csv.writer()

### delimiter

Should be the character used to separate the fields. As the file type says, the default is the comma ','. Depending on the locale, Excel might generate csv files with the semicolon as a delimiter.

```python
import csv

# Read CSV with semicolon delimiter
with open('data_semicolon.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=';')
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

### lineterminator

Character or sequence of characters to end a line. Most common is "\r\n" but it could be "\n".

### quotechar

Character used to quote fields containing special characters (default is `"`).

```python
# Use single quote as quote character
reader = csv.reader(csvfile, quotechar="'")
```
